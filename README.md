**Version**: 1.0.1 (increment the patch/fix version number if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
i start building an API server, which will provide data for the City Explorer Application, allowing a user to search for a location, present a Map, as well as interesting information about the area, all using data from APIs that the server will fetch and manage.

## Getting Started
1. go to this website https://codefellows.github.io/code-301-guide/curriculum/city-explorer-app/front-end/
2. enter my website address.
3. enter the city name.
4. press Explore!.
5. the user will get informations about weather by entering the location.

## Architecture
i did useed : express express cors dotenv librarys and heroku and github and .json packages to git the informations.

## Change Log


04-04-2021 6:00 pm - Application now has a fully-functional express server, with a GET route for the location resource and git informations about the weather.
